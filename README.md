# Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analsis (MFDFA)
We analyzed fractality of canonical/fictaional, non-canonical/fictional and non-fictional texts in our paper [1]. We used [2] to analyze long-range correlations of POS-tags and sentence-length series of texts in our corpus.

You can see the code and a sample series. The sample text, A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, is POS-tagged and the nubmer of nouns in windows of 20 words is counted along the text.
